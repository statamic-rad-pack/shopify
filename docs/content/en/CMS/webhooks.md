There is a built method to listen for webhooks sent by Shopify back to your application. These are validated based on a secret you received when setting them up.

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Head to your Shopify admin
2. Click **Settings > Notifications**
3. Scroll down to **Webhooks** and click **Create Webhook**
4. Enter the URL as shown in the sections below.
5. Leave the type as `JSON` and on the latest API.

If you are trying to test any webhooks locally you'll need to use a service like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to forward your localhost to a secure endpoint.

## Product Create

Rather than running the full import continuously you can add a webhook on **Product Creation** that sends the data to Statamic and queues the import of that one product.

Your URL should point to the following endpoint:

```bash
https://YOURSITE/!/shopify/webhook/product/create
```

## Product Update

Similarly, rather than running the full import to catch any changes to products, you can add a webhook on **Product Update** that sends any updated data to Statamic and queues a refresh of that product.

Your URL should point to the following endpoint:

```bash
https://YOURSITE/!/shopify/webhook/product/update
```

## Product Delete

If you want products to be removed from Statamic whenever you delete them from Shopify, you can add a webhook in Shopify which tells the system to delete the products.

Your URL should point to the following endpoint:

```bash
https://YOURSITE/!/shopify/webhook/product/delete
```

## Order Created

This will scan for all `line_items` and refetch the product data.

Your URL should point to the following endpoint:

```bash
https://YOURSITE/!/shopify/webhook/order
```

## Events

Each webhook listener also fires an event you can use to hook into with your own logic based on the payload received.

The available events are:

`StatamicRadPack\Shopify\Events\ProductCreate`
`StatamicRadPack\Shopify\Events\ProductDelete`
`StatamicRadPack\Shopify\Events\ProductUpdate`
`StatamicRadPack\Shopify\Events\OrderCreate`

Each event has one property `$data` with the payload data decoded to a `stdClass`.
